# Vedham Backend - AI Image Caption Generator


Welcome to the backend repository of Vedham - an AI-powered Image Caption Generator. This backend complements the frontend part of the project and is responsible for handling API requests, processing images, and generating captions using ChatGPT API and Clarifai Image Caption Generation AI API.

## Project Overview

Vedham is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack-based project that leverages AI capabilities to analyze images and produce descriptive captions. The frontend part of the application interacts with this backend to access the AI APIs and retrieve the captions for the provided images.

## Frontend Repository

## Technologies Used

The Vedham backend is developed using the following technologies:

- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime for building scalable and efficient server-side applications.
- Express.js: A flexible and minimalist web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and middleware handling.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing image data and generated captions.
- ChatGPT API: An AI-based API for natural language processing and generating human-like text responses.
- Clarifai Image Caption Generation AI API: An AI API used for image recognition and caption generation based on image content.
